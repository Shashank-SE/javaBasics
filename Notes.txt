 1. if:-
 
Syntax:- 
1. if(condition) {

    // code to be executed if condition is true
    statements;
 }

 if condition written inside paranthesis is true then if body executed.
 otherwise not.


 2. if else:-

 if(Condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
 } else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
 }
 
 when condition is true, control goes inside if block and execute.
 after executing control transfer out of if body.(else block skipped)

 When condition is false control goes inside else block and execute.
 after executing control transfer out of else body.(if block skipeed.)

 3. else if :-

 Syntax: 
      if(condition) {
         // code to be executed if condition is true.
      } 
      else if(condition) {
         // code to be executed if first condition is false.
      }
      else if(condition) {
         // code to be executed if first & second condition is false
      }
      else {
         // code to be executed if all conditions are false.
      }

Relational Operator:- (> < >= <= != ==)

Step1:- create two int type variable
Step2:- read data using scanner
Step3:- decision making.(Logic to find largest)
Step4:- print data


****************************************************

Switch(value/expression) {
   case value/expression : {
      // code to be executed
   } break;

   default {
      // code to be executed if no case match
   }
}

counts the number of factor....


if the number have only two factor(only 1 & itself.) called as prime number.

multiple of a number is always greater than equal(>=) to the number..
